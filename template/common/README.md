# ~NAME~

A game for Playdate~BYLINE~

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn` / `pnpm`), start the watcher:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the `build` and `simulate` tasks whenever files change.

## Building

To build your game's `.pdx`:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can now preview the game in the Playdate Simulator with `npm run simulate`.
